# From Darkness: Twin Worlds (formerly known as Merciless)
This is my first serious programming project. I started it as a University project and still continuing it. It's an RPG text-based game, made fully in Python 3.7.0.

You can also visit my (NOT updated in a long time) website to check the project out in more detail: http://www.merciless.heliohost.org/ ,
although the website is subject to change, along with the website name.
